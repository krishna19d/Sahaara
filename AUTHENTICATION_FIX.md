# 🔧 Firebase Authentication Setup Fix

## ❌ Current Issue
You have **Google Authentication** enabled, but Sahaara needs **Anonymous Authentication** for privacy-first design.

## ✅ Required Steps

### 1. Enable Anonymous Authentication
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/sahaara-a266d/authentication/providers
2. In the "Sign-in method" tab, find **"Anonymous"**
3. Click on **"Anonymous"** 
4. Toggle **"Enable"** to ON
5. Click **"Save"**

### 2. Optional: Keep Google Auth for Future
You can keep Google Authentication enabled too - it won't conflict with Anonymous auth.

### 3. Verify Firestore Security Rules
1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/sahaara-a266d/firestore/rules
2. Make sure rules allow anonymous users:

```javascript
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow anonymous users to read/write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    match /artifacts/{artifactId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### 4. Test Again
After enabling Anonymous auth, run:
```bash
node scripts/firebase-setup.js
```

You should see:
- ✅ Firebase initialized successfully!
- 🎭 Anonymous sign-in test successful!
- 👤 User ID: [anonymous-user-id]

## 🎯 Why Anonymous Authentication?

**Privacy First**: Sahaara is designed for complete anonymity
- No email required
- No personal information stored
- Session-only by default
- Immediate access to mental health support

**Security**: Anonymous users still get:
- Unique user IDs for session management
- Firestore security rules
- Audit trails for safety features
